# CategorizeProduct
## Introduction
Documenting products and their category is essential in

The aim of this project is to train a Natural Language Processing system to identify categories for given products names and descriptions. The dataset used for this training is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/ecommerce-text-classification).

## Model Architecture
The training model layers consist of
*Embedding.
*Long short-term memory (LSTM).
*Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).
*Softmax.
